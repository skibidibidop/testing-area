Exercise 254
|#

; Formulate signatures for the following functions:

; sort_n, which consumes a list of numbers and a function that consumes two
; numbers (from the list) and produces a Boolean. sort_n produces a sorted
; list of numbers

; sort_s, which consumes a list of strings and a function that consumes two
; strings (from the list) and produces a Boolean. sort_s produces a sorted
; list of strings

; Then abstract over the two signatures. Show that the generalized signature
; can be instantiated to describe the signature of a sort function for lists
; of IRs.
