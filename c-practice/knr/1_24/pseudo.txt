Check C program for syntax errors:

Unclosed (), [], {}, '', "", /**/

Incomplete escape sequences

stack[]
line[]
i = 0

Get input, iterate through
	If i == 0
		stack[i] = character
		i++
		continue

	If stack[i - 1] is /
		If character is *
			stack[i] = character

	i++

Print errors:
	"Line # %d: unclosed %c\n", line, stack[]
