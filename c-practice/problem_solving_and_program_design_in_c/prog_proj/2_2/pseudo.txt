Hydroelectric dam design

Details:
    Mass of 1 cubic meter of water is 1000 kg

    Gravitational constant (g) = 9.8 m/(s^2)

    w = (mass)(gravity)(height)
        unit is J

    Power (in watts) = Joule / s
        or 1 w = 1J / s

What's needed
    Compute power (in Megawatts) if 90% of the work done on
        the water by gravity is converted to electricity

Pseudo:
    Get height of dam
        assign to double height

    Get flow (m^3/s)
        assign to double flow

    Get mass from flow
        double mass = flow * 1000<-(define as CUBICM_TO_KG) 

    Calculate w = mgh
        double work = mass * gravity * height

    Get 90% of work
        work = work * .9

    Convert 90% of work to Power in MW
        work = work / 1000
