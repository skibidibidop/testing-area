Exercise 87. Develop a data representation for an editor based on our
first idea, using a string and an index. Then solve the preceding exercises
again. Retrace the design recipe. Hint if you havenâ€™t done so, solve the
exercises in chapter 2.1.

Note on Design Choices
The exercise is a first study of making design
choices. It shows that the very first design choice concerns the data repre-
sentation. Making the right choice requires planning ahead and weighing
the complexity of each. Of course, getting good at this is a question of
gaining experience.
