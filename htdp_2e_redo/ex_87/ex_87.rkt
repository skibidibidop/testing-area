Exercise 87. Develop a data representation for an editor based on our
first idea, using a string and an index. Then solve the preceding exercises
again. Retrace the design recipe. Hint if you havenâ€™t done so, solve the
exercises in chapter 2.1.

Note on Design Choices
The exercise is a first study of making design
choices. It shows that the very first design choice concerns the data repre-
sentation. Making the right choice requires planning ahead and weighing
the complexity of each. Of course, getting good at this is a question of
gaining experience.

; DATA DEFINITION //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

(define-struct editor [text index])
; (make-editor String Non_neg_int)
; Interp.: (make-editor "hi!" 2), represents the current text being edited
; ("hi!") and the index of the 1String to the right of the cursor

; A Non_neg_int is a non-negative integer

; A Valid_key is one of:
; "a" to "z"
; "A" to "Z"
; "left"
; "right"
; "\b"
; special characters (!, ?, *, ,, (, ), etc.)
