Exercise 139. Now take a look at this data definition:

; A List-of-numbers is one of:
; -- '()
; -- (cons Number List-of-numbers)

Some elements of this class of data are appropriate inputs for sum from
exercise 138 and some aren’t.

Design the function pos?, which consumes a List-of-numbers and determines
whether all numbers are positive numbers. In other words, if (pos? l) yields
#true, then l is an element of List-of-amounts. Use DrRacket’s stepper to
understand how pos? works for (cons 5 '()) and (cons -1 '()).

Also design checked-sum. The function consumes a List-of-numbers.
It produces their sum if the input also belongs to List-of-amounts;
otherwise it signals an error. Hint Recall to use check-error.

What does sum compute for an element of List-of-numbers?
