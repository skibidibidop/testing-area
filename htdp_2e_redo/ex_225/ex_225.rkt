Exercise 225. Design a fire-fighting game.

The game is set in the western states where fires rage through vast forests. It
simulates an airborne fire-fighting effort. Specifically, the player acts as the
pilot of an airplane that drops loads of water on fires on the ground. The
player controls the planeâ€™s horizontal movements and the release of water loads.

Your game software starts fires at random places on the ground. You
may wish to limit the number of fires, making them a function of how many
fires are currently burning or other factors. The purpose of the game is to
extinguish all fires in a limited amount of time.
