Exercise 246. Check step 1 of the last calculation

(extract < (cons 6 (cons 4 '())) 5)
==
(extract < (cons 4 '()) 5)

using DrRacketâ€™s stepper.

(define (extract R l t)
  (cond
    [(empty? l) '()]
    [else (cond
            [(R (first l) t)
             (cons (first l)
                   (extract R (rest l) t))]
            [else
             (extract R (rest l) t)])]))

(extract < (cons 6 (cons 4 '())) 5)

; The first step of the last calculation is to cons the first of the
; remaining list to rest of the remaining list.
