Exercise 189. Here is the function search:

; Number List-of-numbers -> Boolean
(define (search n alon)
  (cond
    [(empty? alon) #false]
    [else (or (= (first alon) n)
              (search n (rest alon)))]))

It determines whether some number occurs in a list of numbers. The function may
have to traverse the entire list to find out that the number of interest isnâ€™t
contained in the list.

Develop the function search-sorted, which determines whether a number occurs in
a sorted list of numbers. The function must take advantage of the fact that
the list is sorted.
