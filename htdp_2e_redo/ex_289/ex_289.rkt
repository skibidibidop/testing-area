Exercise 289. Use ormap to define find-name. The function consumes
a name and a list of names. It determines whether any of the names on the
latter are equal to or an extension of the former.

With andmap you can define a function that checks all names on a list
of names that start with the letter "a".

Should you use ormap or andmap to define a function that ensures that
no name on some list exceeds some given width?
