Exercise 165. Design the function subst-robot, which consumes a
list of toy descriptions (one-word strings) and replaces all occurrences of
"robot" with "r2d2"; all other descriptions remain the same.

Generalize subst-robot to substitute. The latter consumes two
strings, called new and old, and a list of strings. It produces a new list of
strings by substituting all occurrences of old with new.
