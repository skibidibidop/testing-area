Full Space War: As always, a UFO is trying to land on Earth. The player’s task
is to prevent the UFO from landing. To this end, the game comes with a tank
that may fire an arbitrary number of shots. When one of these shots comes
close enough to the UFO’s center of gravity, the game is over and the player
won. If the UFO comes close enough to the ground, the player lost.

Exercise 224. Use the lessons learned from the preceding two sections and design
the game extension slowly, adding one feature of the game after another. Always
use the design recipe and rely on the guidelines for auxiliary functions. If you
like the game, add other features: show a running text; equip the UFO with
charges that can eliminate the tank; create an entire fleet of attacking UFOs;
and above all, use your imagination.
