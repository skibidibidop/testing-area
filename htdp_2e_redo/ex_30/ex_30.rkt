Exercise 30.

Sample Problem
The owner of a monopolistic movie theater in
a small town has complete freedom in setting ticket prices. The
more he charges, the fewer people can afford tickets. The less he
charges, the more it costs to run a show because attendance goes
up. In a recent experiment the owner determined a relationship
between the price of a ticket and average attendance.
At a price of $5.00 per ticket, 120 people attend a performance.
For each 10-cent change in the ticket price, the average attendance
changes by 15 people. That is, if the owner charges $5.10,
some 105 people attend on the average; if the price goes down
to $4.90, average attendance increases to 135. Letâ€™s translate this
idea into a mathematical formula:

avg. attendance = 120 people - ($(change in price)/$0.10) * 15 people
