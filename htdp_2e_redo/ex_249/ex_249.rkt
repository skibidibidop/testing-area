Exercise 249. Functions are values: arguments, results, items in lists.
Place the following definitions and expressions into DrRacket’s definitions
window and use the stepper to find out how running this program works:

(define (f x) x)
(cons f '())
(f f)
(cons f (cons 10 (cons (f 10) '())))

The stepper displays functions as lambda expressions; see chapter 17.
