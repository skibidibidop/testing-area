Exercise 45. Design a “virtual cat” world program that continuously
moves the cat from left to right. Let’s call it cat-prog and let’s assume it
consumes the starting position of the cat. Furthermore, make the cat move
three pixels per clock tick. Whenever the cat disappears on the right, it
reappears on the left. You may wish to read up on the modulo function.
