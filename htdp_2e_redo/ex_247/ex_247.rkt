Exercise 247. Evaluate (extract < (cons 8 (cons 4 '())) 5)
with DrRacketâ€™s stepper.
|#

(define (extract R l t)
  (cond
    [(empty? l) '()]
    [else (cond
            [(R (first l) t)
             (cons (first l)
                   (extract R (rest l) t))]
            [else
             (extract R (rest l) t)])]))

(extract < (cons 8 (cons 4 '())) 5)

; The result is (list 4)
