Exercise 269. Define eliminate-expensive. The function consumes
a number, ua, and a list of inventory records, and it produces a list of all
those structures whose sales price is below ua.

Then use filter to define recall, which consumes the name of an inventory item,
called ty, and a list of inventory records and which produces a list of
inventory records that do not use the name ty.

In addition, define selection, which consumes two lists of names and
selects all those from the second one that are also on the first.
