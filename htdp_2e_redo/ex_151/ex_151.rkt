Exercise 151. Design the function multiply. It consumes a natural
number n and multiplies it with a number x without using *.

; N Number -> Number
; Multiplies Natural number n to Number x
(check-within (multiply 2 3) (* 2 3) 0.001)

(define (multiply n x)
  (cond
    [(= n 1) x]
    [else
     (+ x (multiply (- n 1) x))]))
