Exercise 245. Develop the function=at-1.2-3-and-5.775? func-
tion. Given two functions from numbers to numbers, the function deter-
mines whether the two produce the same results for 1.2, 3, and -5.775.

Mathematicians say that two functions are equal if they compute the
same result when given the same inputâ€”for all possible inputs.

Can we hope to define function=?, which determines whether two
functions from numbers to numbers are equal? If so, define the function. If
not, explain why and consider the implication that you have encountered
the first easily definable idea for which you cannot define a function.
