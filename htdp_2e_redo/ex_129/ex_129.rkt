Exercise 129. Create BSL lists that represent

1. a list of celestial bodies, say, at least all the planets in
our solar system;
2. a list of items for a meal, for example, steak, french fries, beans, bread,
water, Brie cheese, and ice cream; and
3. a list of colors.

Sketch some box representations of these lists, similar to those in figures 44
and 45. Which of the sketches do you like better?
