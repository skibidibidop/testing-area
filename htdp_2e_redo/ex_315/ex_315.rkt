Exercise 315. Design the function average-age. It consumes a family forest and
a year (N). From this data, it produces the average age of all child instances
in the forest.

Note
If the trees in this forest overlap, the result isn’t a true average because
some people contribute more than others. For this exercise, act as if
the trees don’t overlap.
