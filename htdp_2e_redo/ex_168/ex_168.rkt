Exercise 168. Design the function translate. It consumes and produces lists
of Posns. For each (make-posn x y) in the former, the latter contains
(make-posn x (+ y 1)). We borrow the word “translate” from geometry, where
the movement of a point by a constant distance along a straight line is
called a translation.
