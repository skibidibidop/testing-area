Exercise 190. Design the prefixes function, which consumes a list of
1Strings and produces the list of all prefixes. A list p is a prefix of
l if p and l are the same up through all items in p. For example, (list "a" "b"
"c") is a prefix of itself and (list "a" "b" "c" "d").

Design the function suffixes, which consumes a list of 1Strings and
produces all suffixes. A list s is a suffix of l if p and l are the same from
the end, up through all items in s. For example, (list "b" "c" "d") is
a suffix of itself and (list "a" "b" "c" "d").
