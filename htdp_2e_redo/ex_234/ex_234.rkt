Exercise 234. Create the function make-ranking, which consumes a
list of ranked song titles and produces a list representation of an HTML
table. Consider this example:

(define one-list
  '("Asia: Heat of the Moment"
    "U2: One"
    "The White Stripes: Seven Nation Army"))

If you apply make-ranking to one-list and display the resulting web
page in a browser, you see something like the screen shot in figure 85.
